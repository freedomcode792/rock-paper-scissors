/* 
    1) Understand the problem
*/

/*Plan:
    1. Write a function that randomly returns into the browser 
    console either "Rock","Paper" or "Scissors". This function will
    provide the computer input.

    2. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock, Paper. Scissors
    The function should take two parameters: playerSelection and 
    computerSelection and should return a message declaring the
    winner.
        1) Output a message such as "rock, paper, scissors!" or something 
        like that, to make the user aware that the round has starter.
        Wrap this into a function.
        2) Prompt the user for input. Input needs to be checked for
        validity. Both of these can be wrapped into functions, but the
        second one absolutely should.
        3)Compare the userChoice with computerChoice and determine the
        winner. Output the result of the match as a string. All of this
        can be done in one function we will call "decideWinner"
